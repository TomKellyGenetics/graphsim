Title: Simulate Expression data from iGraph networks 
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Tom", "Tom Kelly", email = "tom.kelly@postgrad.otago.ac.nz", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Functions to develop simulated continuous data (e.g., gene expression) from a sigma covariance matrix derived from a graph structure in iGraph. Intended to extend mvtnorm to take iGraph structures rather than sigma matrices as input.
