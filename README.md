# graphsim

### Simulate Expression data from iGraph networks

Functions to develop simulated continuous data (e.g., gene expression) from a sigma covariance matrix derived from a graph structure in iGraph. Intended to extend mvtnorm to take iGraph structures rather than sigma matrices as input.

## Installation

To get the dependency package from CRAN:

```R
install.packages(c("igraph", "Matrix", "mvtnorm", "matrixcalc"))
```

To install the stable release of this package from github:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TomKellyGenetics/graphsim", ref = "master")
```

To get the development version of this package from github:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TomKellyGenetics/graphsim", ref = "dev")
```

## Usage

Please see the vignettes for demonstrations of this package on examples of simple simulated networks and the reactome pathway TGF-&beta; receptor signaling activates SMADs (R-HSA-2173789). A manuscript with further details has been submitted for peer-review.
